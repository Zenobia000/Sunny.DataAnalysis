        <p>Taiwan has fired shots at Chinese drones flying overhead for the first time in their history, according to
            the
            country's defence ministry.

            Officials in Taipei confirmed they had discharged live rounds at a civilian drone near the Quemoy
            archipelago at
            around 6pm on Tuesday (August 30) following an incursion in their airspace.

            A military spokesperson confirmed that the drone returned to China once the shots had been fired.

            The incident occurred shortly after President Tsai Ing-wen said she had ordered Taiwan's military to take
            "strong
            countermeasures" against provocations from the Chinese mainland.

            A U.S. official speaking anonymously to the media said China appeared to be using the devices to harass the
            Taiwanese, but was not necessarily seeking an escalation in hostilities.</p>
        <p>
            Complaints from the Taiwanese government regarding the drones have grown in recent weeks after videos of
            army
            positions on the island ended up being circulated media on Chinese social media, with one piece of footage
            reportedly showing troops throwing rocks at the devices.


            There was no immediate response to Tuesday's incident from Beijing, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry had
            earlier
            dismissed their public concerns about the drones on Monday as nothing "to make a fuss about".

            Tensions in the South China Sea reached the highest point in a generation earlier this month when U.S. House
            of
            Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island despite furious protestations from the Chinese.
